tagesschau Roku Channel 
=======================

The [tagesschau Roku channel](https://www.roku.com/channels#!details/3517/tagesschau) allows to stream current videos, complete broadcasts and background information from Germany's trusted public broadcaster ARD using [Roku](http://www.roku.com) streaming players.

This git repository hosts the complete [BrightScript](http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/BrightScript+Language+Reference) source code and artwork of the tagesschau Roku channel. Please note that this channel is *no* official channel by ARD but developed and maintained by [me](https://github.com/henningSaul) as a side project in my spare time. 

There's always something TODO
